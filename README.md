# GitHub RSS Feed

A sophisticated RSS feed generator for tracking GitHub repository activity, designed to demonstrate modern software engineering practices and architectural patterns.

While the core functionality could be implemented simply, this project intentionally showcases enterprise-level engineering approaches including comprehensive testing strategies, CQRS architecture, and containerized deployment.

## Architecture & Engineering Goals

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing Strategy
- **Test Pyramid Implementation**: Emphasizing integration tests over unit tests for better confidence in system behavior
- **High Coverage**: All critical paths covered with meaningful tests

### üîÑ CQRS Pattern Implementation
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation**: Clean separation between read and write operations
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for maintainability and future extension

### üê≥ Containerized Deployment
- **Docker Integration**: Streamlined local development and deployment
- **Environment Consistency**: Eliminates "works on my machine" issues

## Roadmap

This project serves as a foundation for demonstrating additional enterprise patterns and technologies:

- **RESTful API Development**: Clean API design following REST principles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Integration with AWS SQS via LocalStack
- **Polyglot Microservices**: Additional services in different languages

## Getting Started

*[Development instructions will be added as the project evolves]*
